    Automatically convert scss to css file using the following command:
    "sass --watch exercises_styles.scss:exercises_styles.css --sourcemap=none"

    The --watch make sass watch a file (you can also set it to watch a directory)
    and then outputs a file specified after the ":". The --sourcemap stops
    the ".css.map" from being made; this is a file used for debugging and we
    probably won't need it (but you can remove the --sourcemap=none to see the
    file used for debugging).
