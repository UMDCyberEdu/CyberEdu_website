# CyberEdu Website

### A website for CyberEdu coming in Fall 2017

###### NOTE:
The `bulma` folder and any sass files can be removed before deploying the site.
All that is necessary are the html and css files. However, it is good to keep
the `bulma` folder and sass files for future reference and for making changes
in the future.
